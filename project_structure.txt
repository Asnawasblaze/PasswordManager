Notes:
- This file now documents typical filenames you might add to the scaffold. I intentionally did not create Java source files to avoid overwriting your existing project.
- If you want, I can now create a subset of these files (for example: `pom.xml`, `AppLauncher.java`, and a simple `AppTest.java`) inside `project_scaffold/PasswordManager` so the scaffold is runnable.
- Tell me which files to actually create (or say 'create all listed files') and I'll add them with minimal starter content and run a quick build/test.

Project Abstract: Secure Java Password Manager

This project presents a Secure Java Password Manager, a robust desktop application built on the Java platform using the Swing toolkit. The application is meticulously engineered to provide users with a secure, reliable, and user-friendly solution for managing their digital credentials.

The core design employs a layered architecture—comprising Data Access Objects (DAOs), Service layers, and UI components—to ensure high maintainability and testability. Security is paramount, with sensitive data protected using modern cryptographic primitives. Specifically, the application utilizes PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) for robust master key derivation, and AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) for authenticated encryption of all stored credentials, guaranteeing both confidentiality and integrity.

Key functionalities include a streamlined registration and secure login process, TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) setup and verification for enhanced multi-factor authentication, and the ability to add, view, and securely decrypt saved passwords. Usability is further improved through features such as an integrated password generator, a password strength checker, and QR code export for easy credential sharing or TOTP setup.

By adhering to standard Maven conventions and structuring core flows into small, decoupled units, this project achieves a pragmatic balance between security, simplicity, and extensibility, resulting in an application that is easy to build, test, and adapt for future enhancements.

Conclusion for the Secure Java Password Manager Project

In conclusion, the Secure Java Password Manager project successfully delivers a robust and highly usable desktop solution for credential management. By adhering to a layered architecture (UI, Services, and DAOs) and leveraging the simplicity of the Swing framework, the application achieves a clean separation of concerns, which enhances both testability and future extensibility.

Crucially, the project's security foundation—built on PBKDF2 for key derivation and AES-GCM for authenticated encryption—ensures that sensitive user data is protected against modern cryptographic threats. The implementation of features like the integrated password generator, strength checker, and comprehensive TOTP multi-factor authentication setup elevates the application beyond simple storage, providing users with essential tools for creating and maintaining strong digital hygiene.

Ultimately, the password manager meets its goal of balancing security, simplicity, and reliability. It provides a stable and secure vault for user credentials, ready to be deployed, utilized, and easily maintained within a standard Java ecosystem built on Maven conventions.
